# tic-tac-toe

### This is my tic-tac-toe project for the Odin Project (theodinproject.com).
You can see the details of the project here: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-tic-tac-toe.

The requirements for this project included creating a tic-tac-toe game which can be played b/w two players or a player and computer using JS. The focus for this project was on "having as little global code as possible, "try(ing) (to) tuck everything away inside of a module or factory" in order to practic using objects and factory functions.

### JS lessons:
This project taught me a lot about delegating code to functions which can be used over and over. It also taught me a lot about creating and tracking game states which update base on user input.
### CSS/HTML lessons:
To come.

Time spent: 11 hours.
